# 11. Container With Most Water ([LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/))

The **Container With Most Water** problem asks you to find the most water you can trap between two vertical lines drawn on a chart. Each element in the `height` array represents the height of a vertical line at that position.

## 🚀 Simple Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int res = 0;
        int li = 0; 
        int ri = height.length - 1; 

        while (li < ri) {
            int left = height[li];
            int right = height[ri];
            int area = Math.min(left, right) * (ri - li); 
            res = Math.max(res, area); 

            if (left < right) {
                li++;
            } else {
                ri--;
            }
        }
        return res; 
    }
}
```

## 📝 Step-By-Step Explanation in Simple Terms

### 1. **Setting Up**
- We want to find two lines that, together with the x-axis, can form a container that holds the most water.
- We use two pointers:  
  - `li` (left index) starts from the beginning.
  - `ri` (right index) starts from the end.

### 2. **How We Calculate the Area**
- The water the container can hold is determined by:
  - The **shorter** of the two lines.
  - The **distance** between them (right index minus left index).
- **Formula:**  
  `area = min(height[li], height[ri]) * (ri - li)`
- We keep track of the **maximum area** found so far.

### 3. **Why Move the Shorter Line?**
- If we move the taller line, the height can only stay the same or decrease, and the width gets smaller, so the area can't get bigger.
- But if we move the shorter line, there’s a chance the next line might be taller, which could give a bigger area even as the width shrinks.

### 4. **Loop Until the Pointers Meet**
- We repeat this process, moving the shorter line inward each time.
- When the two pointers meet, we have checked all possibilities.

### 5. **Return the Largest Area**
- After the loop, `res` contains the biggest area found.

## 🧑‍💻 Example Dry Run

Suppose `height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`

| li | ri | height[li] | height[ri] | width | area | max area |
|----|----|------------|------------|-------|------|----------|
| 0  | 8  | 1          | 7          | 8     | 8    | 8        |
| 1  | 8  | 8          | 7          | 7     | 49   | 49       |
| 1  | 7  | 8          | 3          | 6     | 18   | 49       |
| 1  | 6  | 8          | 8          | 5     | 40   | 49       |
| ...| ...| ...        | ...        | ...   | ...  | ...      |

- The **maximum area** is **49** (between lines at index 1 and 8).

## 🛠️ Edge Cases

1. **All heights are zero:**  
   - Example: `[0,0,0,0]`  
   - Max area is 0; no water can be held.

2. **Only two lines:**  
   - Example: `[5,5]`  
   - Only one area possible: `min(5,5) * 1 = 5`

3. **Decreasing or increasing heights:**  
   - Example: `[1,2,3,4,5]`  
   - The max area is often not at the ends; the algorithm still finds the best pair.

4. **Large input size:**  
   - The solution is efficient – it only needs to look at each pair once (O(n) time).
