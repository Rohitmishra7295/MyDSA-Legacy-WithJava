# üìö Power of K in n! 

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **What is the Problem?**

**üéØ Problem Statement**:  
Given two integers **n** and **k**, find the largest integer **e** such that **k·µâ divides n!** completely.

### ‚ú® In Simple Words
How many times can we multiply **k** with itself so that it perfectly divides **n!** without remainder?

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Why Does This Problem Exist?**

- **Factorials** grow fast and contain many prime factors.
- We want to know: **how many full sets of k can be "packed" into n!**
- **Analogy**:
- Real-Life Thought:
- Suppose you have n! chocolates.
- Each k·µâ is a special chocolate box.
- How many full boxes can you make?

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **How Do We Approach This?**

### Case 1: **k is Prime**
- Use **Legendre‚Äôs Formula** to count its power in n!

### Case 2: **k is Composite**
- Split k into its **prime factors**.
- For each prime, count its power in n! and divide by its exponent in k.
- The **minimum among them** is the answer.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Legendre‚Äôs Formula (Why & How)**

### Why?
Counts **how many times a prime p divides n!**, including all its multiples (p, p¬≤, p¬≥, ...).

### How?
> **Power of p in n! = floor(n/p) + floor(n/p¬≤) + floor(n/p¬≥) + ...** until term becomes 0

#### Example:
For n = 10, p = 2:  
- floor(10/2) = 5  
- floor(10/4) = 2  
- floor(10/8) = 1  
- floor(10/16) = 0 (stop)  
**Total = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8**  
So, 2‚Å∏ divides 10!

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Composite k ‚Äî The Twist!**

### Why?
k is made of multiple primes, so each must have enough presence in n! for k·µâ to divide n!.

### How?
1. Factorize k into primes: `k = p‚ÇÅ^q‚ÇÅ √ó p‚ÇÇ^q‚ÇÇ √ó ...`
2. For each prime p·µ¢:
   - Count power in n! using Legendre‚Äôs formula.
   - Divide by its exponent in k: `power_p·µ¢_in_n! √∑ q·µ¢`
3. **Answer = Minimum of all these values**

```java
public class PowerOfKInN {
    // Returns the highest power e such that k^e divides n!
    public static int highestPower(int n, int k) {
        int result = Integer.MAX_VALUE;  // Start big; we're looking for the minimum
        int num = k;  // We'll factorize k

        // 1. Factorize k into primes up to sqrt(k)
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= num; i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) { // Found a prime factor
                int count = 0;
                while (num % i == 0) { // Count its exponent in k
                    count++;
                    num /= i;
                }
                // 2. Use Legendre's formula for power of i in n!
                int temp = 0, p = i;
                while (p <= n) {
                    temp += n / p;
                    p *= i;
                }
                // 3. Divide by its exponent in k, update result
                result = Math.min(result, temp / count);
            }
        }

        // 4. If there's a remaining prime factor > sqrt(k)
        if (num > 1) {
            int temp = 0, p = num;
            while (p <= n) {
                temp += n / p;
                p *= num;
            }
            result = Math.min(result, temp); // Its exponent in k is 1
        }

        return result; // This is the answer: largest e so k^e divides n!
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(highestPower(10, 6)); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

**Line-by-Line Story:**
- **result = Integer.MAX_VALUE**: We want the minimum among all prime factors.
- **num = k**: We'll break k apart.
- **for (int i = 2; ...)**: Try all possible primes up to sqrt(k).
- **if (num % i == 0)**: Found a prime that divides k.
- **while (num % i == 0)**: Count how many times (exponent) it divides k.
- **Legendre's formula loop**: Counts power of prime in n!.
- **result = Math.min(result, temp / count)**: Adjust by exponent and keep the lowest.
- **If num > 1**: After loop, if anything‚Äôs left it‚Äôs a large prime; treat similarly.
- **return result**: That‚Äôs our answer.
